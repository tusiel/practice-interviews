# String
We are given a string S of length that consists of zeros and ones. We would like to modify it in such a way that it will not contain the substring "010". (A substring is a subsequence of consecutive characters.) The only allowed operations is the inversion of individual bits (i.e. replacement of a '1' with a '0' or replacement of a '0' with a '1'). Write the application which returns the minimal number of replacements that are needed to modify string S so that it will not contain the substring "010".

## Example
If you are given the string "0101010" then with two operations you can modified it to "1101110", so the application should return 2.
